      "longDescription": [
        "The Pothole Detection Tool is an innovative and comprehensive system designed to address one of the most pressing challenges in road safety and infrastructure maintenance—detecting and mitigating potholes. This tool leverages advanced technologies, including image processing, IoT, and machine learning, to provide an efficient and scalable solution for pothole detection and management.",
        "Potholes are a significant cause of road accidents, vehicle damage, and economic losses. They also pose a challenge to road authorities in terms of timely detection and repair. This project aims to bridge the gap by providing an automated system that not only identifies potholes but also generates detailed reports, calculates repair costs, and facilitates seamless communication with road authorities.",
        "The project incorporates the use of accessible technologies such as CCTV and mobile cameras to capture road condition data. These images are then processed using advanced algorithms in Python and OpenCV to detect potholes accurately. In addition, the system includes IoT-enabled devices like ESP32CAM for real-time monitoring in remote areas, enhancing its adaptability and scalability.",
        "<strong>Key features of the tool include:</strong><ul class='list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1'><li>Image Processing: Capturing and analyzing road condition images to detect potholes.</li><li>Volume and Cost Estimation: Automatically calculating the size and volume of detected potholes and providing an estimated repair cost.</li><li>Location-Specific Reporting: Generating reports with precise location details for quick action.</li><li>Authority Communication: Facilitating efficient communication with organizations such as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for repair and maintenance tasks.</li></ul>",
        "This project reflects a significant step forward in the use of technology for societal benefits, aiming to improve road safety, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance public satisfaction. The Pothole Detection Tool stands as a testament to the potential of technological innovations in solving real-world problems.",
